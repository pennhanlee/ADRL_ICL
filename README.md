Evaluating the Adversarial Robustness of Reinforcement Learning System

This is a research that evaluates the adversarial robustness of Offline Reinforcement Learning agents and there are three attacks investigated in the report.

1. Untargeted Attack
2. Targeted Attack
3. Control Attack

The code for Untargeted Attack is in `mujoco_untargeted_attack` folder
The code for Targeted Attack is in `gridworld_targeted_control_attack` folder
The code for Control Attack (DISCRETE ENVIRONMENT) is in the `gridworld_targeted_control_attack` folder
The code for the Control Attack (CONTINUOUS ENVIRONMENT) is in `carracing_control_attack` folder
